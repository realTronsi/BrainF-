# Duplicating Cells

You can duplicate cells using this very handy code:

```
[->+>+<<]
```

This will copy the current cell into the next to cells on the right and delete the starting cell

```
++
[->+>+<<]
>>
```
##### `=> 0 2 [2]`

If you want to keep the starting cell, you can do the reverse process:

```
++
[->+>+<<]
>[-]>
[-<+<+>>]
<
```
##### `=> 2 [2]`
