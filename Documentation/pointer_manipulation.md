# Pointer Manipulation

Not only can you move the pointer left or right using `<` and `>`, you can jump the pointer to an index using `*`

When `*` is used, the pointer's position will change to that of the current cell value

```
++ add 2 to current cell
* jumps pointer to index of 2
```
##### `=> 2 0 [0]`
