# Pointer Manipulation

Not only can you move the pointer left or right using `<` and `>`, you can jump the pointer to an index using `*`

When `*` is used, the pointer's position will change to that of the current cell value

```
++ add 2 to current cell
* jumps pointer to index of 2
```
##### `=> 2 0 [0]`

#

You can use `?` to set the current cell value to the position of the pointer

```
>>>?
```
##### `=> 0 0 0 [3]`
